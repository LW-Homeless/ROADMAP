Sample solution for the [GitHub-User-Activity](https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-user-activity) challenge from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh)

# GitHub User Activity
In this project, you will build a simple command line interface (CLI) to fetch the recent activity of a GitHub user and display it in the terminal. This project will help you practice your programming skills, including working with APIs, handling JSON data, and building a simple CLI application.

# Requirements
The application should run from the command line, accept the GitHub username as an argument, fetch the userâ€™s recent activity using the GitHub API, and display it in the terminal. The user should be able to:

- Provide the GitHub username as an argument when running the CLI.
`python github-activity <username>`

- Fetch the recent activity of the specified GitHub user using the GitHub API. You can use the following endpoint to fetch the user's activity:
 https://api.github.com/users/ **username** /events
 Example:  https://api.github.com/users/ **LW-Homeless** /events

# Solution
